# ExceptionHandler
A library to assist when a unhandled exception occurs in the program. Automatically sends notification to your Android phone when an error occurs. Also provides method to send notification to phone for info, warning etc. (<b>Not limited only to exceptions)

Currently supports Java and Python.

This library is more suitable for automated scripts/programs or ones that runs forever, where you can be notified when something happens instead of you repeatedly looking into log files.

Also during development, when an error occurs it searches stackoverflow site and provides results.


#Features
- Send notification to your Android phone (This requires installing android app)
